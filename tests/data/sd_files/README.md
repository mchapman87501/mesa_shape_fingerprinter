# About These Files

The `cox2_3d` files are derived from test data in the old Mesa Analytics svn repository.

`structures.molV3.sdf` was downloaded from [DrugCentral 2023](https://drugcentral.org/download) on 2025/07/25.

`chemminer_v3000_sample.sdf` is derived from a sample structure that was downloaded from https://cluster.hpcc.ucr.edu/~tgirke/Documents/R_BioCond/Samples/v3000.sdf. Its coordinates have been scaled down by a factor of 100; and some non-zero Z coordinates have been added.

`v3_sample.sdf` and `bad_mols_v3000.sdf` are derived from `structures.molV3.sdf`.
